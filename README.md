# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts the median house value in California based on various housing features. It combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, and a trained Linear Regression model, which is deployed through a user-friendly Streamlit application for real-time predictions.

# 📌 Project Details
Using the California Housing dataset, this project focuses on building a regression model that can estimate property prices based on factors like income, rooms, population, and proximity to the ocean. The pipeline includes log transformations, feature engineering, and one-hot encoding, followed by model training using Linear Regression

The app allows users to input values via interactive widgets and instantly see predicted prices, making it a practical tool for showcasing applied machine learning.
